        I love travelling. I love the <b><i>art</i></b> of planning a trip, but I hate the tools that are currently available.
        They're always either too complex, or too simple.<br />
        Being a junior develeoper (but mostly) an engineer, I always look for ways to fix my problems or, 
        at least, to make my life easier.<br />
        This is why I created Picsnicx.<br />To solve a problem.
